  <h3>Week 1: Circuit Boards </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <p> This week we got to learn how to add components to breadboards. We specifically used a microcontroller, wires, a resistor, and an LED in circuit to get the LED to turn on. We used the 3V output from the microcontroller, but also played with the bat (battery) output, which had less voltage and a dimmer light, and the 5V USB output to get a brigher light. </p>

      <img src="./sew.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:20%" alt="Sew">

      <p> We also used a multimeter to measure the voltage drop through the resister (and then used Ohms Law V = I R to calculate the current since we know the resistance). We also measured the voltaged drop through the LED. 

      </p>

      <p> I am still a bit confused about 1) where the voltage drop in the LED came from and how we can calculate this based on current, and 2) how to set up and use arduino software. The code makes sense, but connecting the microcontroller to our computer so we can write code onto it has not worked for me yet. </p>
