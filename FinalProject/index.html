  <h3>Potential Final Project Ideas </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <p> One idea I had for a final project was to create a device to help monitor and water plants. My roommate told me that plants need to be watered later in the day so that the water doesn't evaporate too much in the sunlight. However, often this late afternoon time is hard for college students with busy and changing schedules. Also, often students forget to water their plants or don't know how much to water their plants. I want to create a device, built out of wood or cardboard, with holes for different sized pots. This device will also have a water tank that can be refilled. The user will have the option to set timings for when they want their plants watered and how often. Using arduino or some other technology, this device will automatically release water from the tank into each plant at the requested interval. To release the water, I am unsure about how to do this, but maybe using transistors as a switch to trigger some release mechanism. </p>
