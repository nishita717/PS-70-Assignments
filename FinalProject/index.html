  <h3>Final Project Idea</h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <p> My first final project idea was to develop a technology that can automatically sort items into trash, recycling and compost. This would use some kind of sensor to visually see and feel the material to determine what category it belongs to. </p>
      <p> My second idea is to develop something that can automatically water plants at when it senses different plants need more water. </p>

      <p> With the transition to online classes, I am still interested in making an automatic plant waterer. I picked up some circuit component pumps from the lab so hopefully can incorporate those and maybe even test them on plants in my home! </p>
