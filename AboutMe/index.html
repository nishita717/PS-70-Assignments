      <p> Hi! I'm Nishita, but I usually go by Nish (the fish)! I'm a junior in Mather studying Physics and Global Health and Health Policy. My hobbies include hiking, climbing, dancing, and running and I also love making new friends and trying new foods (especially desserts). I'm really excited for this course because I love Physics but really want hands-on Engineering experience. I'm also excited to meet other friends and work with them throughout the course.  </p>
